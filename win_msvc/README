HA archiver port to Windows (win32) / Microsoft Visual C (MSVC)

This port was made by val khokhlov just to be able to unpack old archives created in 90s, as the original HA version was 16-bit.
It is based on DOS (Borland C) files found in pc/ with some changes and additions:
1. File time functions in machine.c taken from the Unix version, as MSVC works with Unix time.
2. Path handling functions retained from the DOS version, so the mask *.* is for all files and \ is directory separator.
3. File attributes are read and set with Windows API functions, but only DOS attributes are supported by HA (see dir.h).
4. As MSVC lacks dirent.h functionality, a simple dirent.c implementation was written with opendir(), readdir(), closedir().
5. Nico de Vries (AIP-NL) Borland C++ 3.1 compatibility edits in c/acoder.c retained.

Actually, HA works fine under Windows to my tests with two limitations known:
1. File names converted to the lower case when archived (probably can get rid of it just like in Unix version).
2. Long files names got stripped when files extracted from archives (maybe will be possible to remove 8.3 name limits).
